***APPROACH ALL OF THESE AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO RELEASE THIS***
even if you don't, it'll make everything easier

geometry hierarchy system
matrix transformations
built-in shapes (square, rectangle, circle)
    these will deform partially during startup
    and partially for every frame, as usual
animations...bleh how
colors. per line? per shape? per geometry?
deformation (precision?) is proportionate to line length
    short lines have less recursion
    long lines have lotssssss
can you combine 2d and 3d under the same geometry stuff?
fill 2d shape with texture? paper texture? eek that sounds tough

DEMO IDEA...I LIKE THIS
go back to graphics hw and find wireframe renderer
make this demo start in 2d
then the character can draw or build
he can turn shapes 3d (wireframe modez)
now 3d things can rotate, 2d things stay still
**different colored backgrounds for different environments

HOW DOES THIS ALL FIT INTO CHALK TALK??
story telling?
game making?

random thought, but chalk talk package manager...
repo at url should contain image, description, etc
voting and ranking system
